# PPPoE Demo Application

This demo application contains the minimum amount of code needed to demonstrate the [PPPoE object](http://docs.tibbo.com/taiko/object_pppoe.htm). With it, your programmable Tibbo device should be able to dial an ADSL modem and get a connection to the Internet.

Again, this application is very bare-bones, and that is intentional: we made it so you can easily see how things work, and take any code you want for your own projects. Think of it as a basis for further development.

The application demonsrates establishing a PPPoE link and then connects to a remote IP of the user's choice. It is described in the [manual](http://docs.tibbo.com/taiko/lib_pppoe_code_examples.htm).
